              <p>So where you wanna go?" Arjun said with a volume up while driving.
"Anywhere. I mean you know this city better. Just show me your places." She replied.
"Hmm OK."
With a sudden break, Kritika bumped on Arjun.
She smiled, "All you boys are the same."
"Why you girls are so stereotype? By the way that was not intentional; there was a dog I tried to dodge." He replied.
 Their ride continued. After a few kilometers, he stopped the bike.

"Ohk. Marine Drive." She announced to herself. That big smile on her face confessed her euphoria. This place was at the top of her 'Mumbai Dasrhan' wish list.
They sat down side way facing the sea.
"I love this place. Whenever I feel low, upset or frustrated, I just come over here and sit in silence. These breezes, the music of waves, inspire me to think for my write-ups." He said relaxing.
"Cool. So you write?" She asked.
"Yeah sometimes." He answered with a low voice.
That lack of confidence in his voice made her anxious. She wanted to know the reason behind that face. So she asked, "You Ok? Is there anything bothering you?"
"No. I am fine." He replied.
"But you can share anything if you feel so." She advised.
He nodded.
For a few minutes there was complete silence. None of the two conversed for a while. They closed their eyes feeling the winds, loving the tranquility.
After a deep breath, he confessed, "You know what? I am just confused."
"About what?" She asked softly.
"I am doing Engineering. But I love writing." He stated.
"So you wanna decide between them as your career?" She guessed.
"I don't know. I mean engineering was something I can do better than any other thing. But then I came to know about my love for writing. It's like if a career in engineering is going to fill my bank balance then becoming a writer will satisfy my soul."
"I am just confused whether to go for money and a stable life or just follow my dream. You know there is a very big difference between saying something & implementing that to your real life." He added.
"Whatever you do, just make sure 10 years from now you can say proudly that you chose your life." She said with positivism.
The atmosphere out there comforted the conversation.
"Don't think what people will say. Just listen to your heart. Because in the end, you are the one living your life." She suggested.
"Just ask yourself, whether you wanna impress the world as an Engineer or as a Writer?" Kritika continued.
He went into a deep contemplation.
This time, her words influenced him & impressed him too.

"Kritika......" He said softly.
"Yesss....." She replied in a flow.
They started enjoying each other’s company by now.
"Now you know a little bit about mine, wanna share your story?" He asked.
"I do not have much to share. Since childhood I was interested in mysteries. Stories about crime, murder always attracted me. That’s why I chose law. Don't judge me but CID once used to be my favourite TV show."
They laughed in unison.
"And dad? I haven’t met him today." He asked.
"He no longer lives with us." Her tone saddened.
"You know, I had a relationship. I was living a different world in that. But one day he left, without saying anything, without giving any reason. Just like what dad did years ago. And that day I realised people will eventually go if they’ve decided, holding relations too tight is going to hurt you only." She continued.
"Anyway, I am over it now.  Career is my first priority. What about you, any girlfriend?" She asked recollecting all her emotions back.
Suddenly his serious face turned into a smile, "No not at all. Though I have many female friends but not a girlfriend."
"Are you............?" She tried to change the mood by teasing him.
"NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. I am completely straight." He stated.

"It's just that I do not believe in love. It never happened to me. And having a girlfriend just for a tag of relationship is not my thing. I hate it when someone plays with your feelings." He continued.
"And one thing I've seen is that, no matter how genuine or strong your relationship is, it’s gonna end one day. The reason can be a strong one or a foolish one. But it will." He stated.
"Hmmm." She was listening to his words carefully.
"By the way, this is getting deep now. And that's not good for my emotions. Aren't you feeling hungry? He asked.
"Badly. But which shop will be open yet. At 2:30 in the morning?"
"Don't worry baby, this is Mumbai. Let's go." He winked.
They walked towards the bike.

"Am I boring?" He asked.
"Why?" She looked surprised.
"No, mostly people think the same about me."
"Nobody is boring. Everyone has a galaxy within them."
"Hmm, they just have different wavelengths, right?” He added.
“Exactly.” She laughed.
He started the bike.
"So what is our next destination?" She asked.
"Juhu.." He smiled.
She blushed.

Because of only a few vehicles on the road, they reached Juhu within 40 minutes.
When he was about to park the bike, Kritika said something in a tensed voice, "Arjun..."
"Ya...?" He replied.
"I think someone is following us." She was worried.
"What? Who?" He asked surprised.
"Someone in that black Mercedes there." she said pointing towards that car.
"It can be a co-incidence." He suggested.
"No it can't be. I’ve been observing that car; they are continuously following us from marine drive." She answered.
"Then let's check it out."
"Wait. No. Why?"
"Aree don't worry madam. You are with me." He turned the bike and drove towards that black Mercedes.
 Arjun blocked the car’s way and shouted, "Hey you. Get out of the car."
A tall, handsome, clean shaved guy, with great physique, dressed in formals came out of the car. He looked no less than a millionaire.
Kritika was shocked.
She whispered, "WHAT. THE. FUCK."
