              <p>“You...?” That face was familiar to her.
“What you are doing here?” She shouted.
“Kritika, I just want to talk.” The guy replied.
“No, but I don’t. Just get lost you bloody stalker.” She was in complete anger.
“Listen, I can explain everything. Just give me a chance.” He walked towards her.
“Don’t you dare to come close to me. And why, why do you want a chance now. You went disappeared. Where were you when I needed you the most?” She said with a heavy voice.
“You are such a douche bag. Get the fuck out of here. I can’t bare your face in front of my eyes anymore.” She was in no mood to listen to him.
“Why? Because of him? Who is he?  Your new boyfriend?” He shouted arguing.
“Just shut up. You do not have any right to interfere in my life again. Leave us alone.” She stated.
“I shifted to Delhi 10 months ago. I wanted to inform you, but…” He stopped.
“But what Karan? You do not have any reply now.” She shouted.
“You haven’t picked up my calls, never replied to my texts, after that night. What I did wrong to you?” She spoke with tears in her eyes.
Arjun was just watching the argument from a distance. Till now, he was sure that this guy is Kritika’s Ex. He was shocked. He didn’t want to interfere in their personal matter, so he remained silent.
“You know I love you a lot. I realized my mistakes. That’s why I came back to you. Don’t you love me? Have you forgotten that night?” He said in a desperate tone and grabbed her wrist.
“Leave me Karan, it’s hurting.” She shouted in pain.
“Hey dude, leave her hand.” Arjun ran towards them.
He pushed down Arjun and shouted, “Stay away you asshole. I think you are the reason behind all this. You washed up her mind.” Then he pulled Kritika towards his car.
She opposed him, “What are you doing?”
Arjun stood up in anger and punched him on his face. So powerfully that it made Karan fall on the road.
Arjun held Kritika’s hand and said in fear, “Let’s go Kritika. Fast.”
“No.” She shouted.
“He has to pay for all his doings.”
She started hitting him. Anyone can imagine the amount of pain and anger she had, from her face.
Karan tried to defend himself. But he failed.
Arjun knew that it was the anger from her heart, the loneliness she suffered. So he let Kritika get mad.
After hitting a powerful kick on his groin,
Kritika ran & shouted, “Now run stupid, otherwise the police will lock us up all this night.”
“Ohh Shit.” He exhaled.
They ran towards the bike.
“Give me the keys.” She said.
“What?” He asked confirming what he just heard was actually true or not.
“Give me the bike’s key damn it.” She shouted again, louder this time.
He threw the keys towards her, still in shock, trying to understand what has just happened.
“Now sit behind me.” She said from the bike.
“You sure?  Do you know how to drive a bike?” He asked worried.
“Aree sit you idiot. Ask everything later.” She said in anger.
She started the bike and they went far.
She was driving fast, too fast. Even faster than Arjun.
 Arjun was confused, whether this was her anger or she just wanted to run away. But scared to ask anything.
After a few kilometers, she stopped the bike road side in a deserted street.
As they got off the bike, she started crying. Crying her heart out, taking out the pain she has suffered all this time.
Arjun was just standing there watching her cry. He knew this was important, interrupting her was not gonna help anyhow.
The next moment, she came towards Arjun, hugged him tightly and continued to sob.
He knew that she just needed someone to listen to her. So he comforted her with that hug, telling her that he was there for her.
Kritika came back to her senses and broke the hug realizing that she was with a stranger.
“Sorry.” She whispered wiping her tears.
“It’s OK” He replied avoiding an eye contact.
“Let’s sit somewhere.” He added.
They sat down on a small platform before a closed shop, under a street lamp.
“Actually it was not his mistake. It was me who thought he could never leave me. I loved him from all my heart.” She started sharing her feelings.
“Do not think like this.” He suggested.
“No, just for one person you ignore and break a lot of relations. But when that person leaves, you are left all alone.”
“I believed that he loves me too. But I didn’t knew that he was just waiting for that night only. I trusted him, thinking that this will take our relation to a next level. But that proved to be my biggest mistake. That day I thought I was going to share my virginity with him, but I lose to him. I lost my trust, my belief. I lost myself.” She continued.
“Listen, why are you blaming yourself? If a fucking bastard cheated on you, what was your mistake? You are strong, powerful. Who knew that you have such karate skills? Don’t let people pull you down. You are worthy enough to be happy, to love someone and be loved back. Never doubt yourself. And I just don’t get this concept of Virginity. I mean why people only ask girls if they are virgin or not? Are boys out of this concept? See, shit happens. But you have to move on from that. Do not give anyone, the power to control your life.” With a little rudeness, he tried to convince her.
She listened to him having a constant emotional expression on her face.
“You know this whole year, I build up myself completely. I moved on in life. I had gone through a really bad phase. Nobody was there when I really needed one.” She said.
“Life is not going to be a straight line. It’s a graph of ‘sin x’, has its own ups and downs. This life is a journey; people will be a part of your journey. Not everyone is going to be there with you when you’ll reach your destination. Love yourself. You are the one who’ll be there for you always. You never know, when this life will take a new turn.” He explained.
“Hmm…” She stopped crying.
“Hey its getting too late now, almost 4:00 A.M. And I am damn hungry.” He confessed.
“O.K let’s leave.”
“Do you want Anda-Bhurji? I mean at this time, in this area, there is a stall nearby. He makes awesome anda-bhurji.”  He asked.
“Don’t tell me you are a vegetarian.” He added.
“No.” She finally smiled.
“I hope you don’t have any problem with a road side stall like those kinda hi-fi over hygienic girls.” He commented.
“No way dude. I am that typical ‘chai ke tapre wali’ girl.” She laughed.
“By the way, I get your perception about life, except that mathematical relation. And yeah I am a black belt in karate.” She winked.
“What?” He shouted in surprise.
“Now give me the keys back. I am riding.” She decided.
“You almost killed my male ego, girl.” He laughed.
After having the food they drove back to Kritika’s home.
 She strongly applied the brakes  in front of her house. This time Arjun bumped on her.
“And you girls blame us for this.” He blushed.
She laughed.
“You are not coming inside?” She asked.
“Your intention doesn’t seem right. What you want baby?” He winked with a grin.
“No improvement in your flirting skill. Still poor af.” She said with fake disappointment.
They laughed.
“I need to go now.  You go and sleep. Happy Birthday again. And don’t worry, when I’ll come back to pickup mom in the morning, I’ll take your number.” He smiled.
“Thank you. And first improve your flirting skills. You are not getting my number that easily.” She winked.
“Ok Bye.” She went inside.
Arjun was there alone checking his mobile notifications sitting on his bike. Then he started the bike and was about to leave when someone hit him strongly on his head from behind, with something powerful, like a baseball bat. He fell down on the road unconscious.
