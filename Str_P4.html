Arjun woke up. It was around 5 in the morning, which was according to his daily routine. He checked his mobile phone.
Kritika was online.

He: Hey Happy Birthday Kritika. Gud Mrng.
She: Gud Morning Arjun. And Thank u so much.

“<3”

 He typed. But the thumb shivered to press the send button. So he erased.

Later that Morning,

“Arjun…. Arjun…?” Sameer shouted entering the house.
“He is in his room beta.” Mom directed him.
Without even knocking, he just entered in Arjun’s room.
“Are you even alive asshole?” He shouted.
“Hey, keep your volume low. This is not our college, avoid such words here.” Arjun whispered.
“Look who is talking. Our god of vulgar language.” He laughed.
“Shhh….. Slow. You will surely get me killed!!” Arjun whispered again.
They hugged each other with a big laugh, as they are meeting after almost 2 months.
Sameer and Arjun are college friends. And the 3 years of engineering life yet binded them in an unbreakable bond called friendship.
Sameer jumped on Arjun’s bed and lied there, showing one of the characters of a best friend.
“So, big day man. How are you feeling?” Sameer asked.
“Yaar phati padi hai.” Arjun replied with nervousness.
Sameer laughed, “Why?”
“What I am gonna do today? I have never spoke in front of a huge public in my life. You know I have a phobia of public speaking.” Arjun confessed.
“Don’t worry dude. You have a great practice of giving motivational speeches to me and Himanshu. You almost sound like a speaker. The motivational one.” Sameer Encouraged.
“Aree, but that’s a different thing.”
“Relax. It’s going to be good.”
“Hmm… But more than this I am confused about Kritika,” Arjun said.
“All Good?” Sameer asked.
“Yeah but, because of today’s nervousness, I slept at around 9:30 last night. It almost skipped from my mind that it’s her birthday today.”
“Bhai except her, everybody knows that you love her. Even though you never confessed, but it’s quite visible from your body language.” Sameer conceded.
“I loved that girl since the day I met her. But I haven’t confessed this to her yet. She taught me what being in love feels like. When you love someone, you even love their flaws. Their every small effort makes you blissful. You check their DP all day. Every single day feels a blessing. You cannot control your actions. It’s like you are spell bounded by their existence which even they are not aware of.” Arjun said in a go.
Sameer stared at him with widen eyes and a semi opened mouth.
“You are deeply in love bro…” Sameer declared.
“I think I am.” Arjun confessed
“This is your first love na, it happens. But it’s good, belatedly but at least you fell for someone.” Sameer smiled mischievously.
“But isn’t it the sweetest thing in the world. I mean you & Kavya are together for more than 4 years and everything is going fine.” Arjun stated.
“Love is not that simple bhai. You have to be mature enough to deal with the baggage that comes along. And all it requires is effort. The relation will continue until you two are willing to invest. But that’s all a deep shit. You’ll come to know this later. For now just remember, ‘If it’s meant to be, it will find its way. Love unconditionally, but never crave for it. You cannot force someone to love you. It just happens.” Sameer said.
“Wow that was impactful. Now who is the philosopher?” Arjun commented.
“Everyone is a philosopher in this world. They simply have their own concepts of life.” Sameer replied.
“Hmm… But tell me what I should do. Because this is the only thing that keeps my mind occupied nowadays. My mind is clouded by her thoughts.” Arjun asked confused.
“Dude breath. Just go to her and say everything you have just said about love. I think that’s enough.”Sameer suggested.
“Yes, I’ll tell her about my feelings today. And how should I propose her?” Arjun asked.
“With all your true core. You don’t need those hearts and flowers to tell someone how mesmerizing their presence in your life is. True feelings and trust are the most precious gifts you can ever give to your loved one.” Sameer winked.
“And I need to go now. Himanshu needs my bike.” He added.
“For what?” Arjun asked.
“He is going for a movie with his antique girlfriend.” Sameer Replied.
“He’ll never focus on his career.” Arjun said.
“And he is a perfect example of all the negative consequences love can lead to.” Sam commented.
“Hmmm..”
“By the way, be on time tonight.” Arjun requested.
“We’ll reach before time bro. bye.” Sameer replied.

At the evening, Arjun was getting ready for the night’s event when his mom entered in his room.
“You ready Arjun?” She said.
“Yes mom, almost.”
“So tell me how are you feeling?”
“Same as what you are feeling.” He smiled.
“I am proud of you my son.” Mom said adjusting his blazer.
“Thank you for your support maa.”
“Is dad coming tonight?” Arjun asked.
“I don’t know. We haven’t talked about it yet.” Mom replied.
“Does he even know, what this day means to me?” He was saddened.
“Yes I have told him about today.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there na.”
“Mom you know, today my dream is coming true, the dream of being a writer, publishing my first book. And at that moment I want everyone that really mean in my life to be present there.”
“Hmmm. I know. I’ll talk to him. But you know your dad.”
“Oh I forgot.” Mom handed him a small pocket diary with a pen.
“And what it is for?” He asked.
“Just wanted your first autograph Mr. Writer.” Mom said with a big grin.
“Oh come-on maa.” He felt overwhelmed. This was the best compliment or appreciation he ever wanted in life.
“Aree. Sign it.” Mom asked,
“Your are getting senti now.” He saw those tears of happiness in her eyes.
“I know you also wanted to be a writer. I have read your ‘Kavitae’. And they can be directly added to the Hindi syllabus of the higher secondary students. They are that much impressive.” Arjun stated.
“But you are aware that I left writing even before you were born. Your father never liked literature.”
“You know I am living my dream with you. I am more than happy today. It feels like my dream is coming true. And this is what being a mother is all about. I have seen your hard work all this time. Believe me, it will pay. And one day, your dad will know this too.” She said with tears of happiness. She was basking in the glory and pride of his son’s success.
“And this is getting too melodramatic now.” She wiped her tears giggling.
“Now I know why I am this much emotional. It is genetic.” He commented.
“You get ready fast, don’t be late. And best of luck.”
She left the room.

Arjun Drove to the Granth Book Store at Santacruz west. It was around 7p.m.
He reached there an hour before the event, to make himself comfortable with the place with a heady mixture of nervousness, excitement, satisfaction and with a tinge of pride in his heart.
He parked the bike and entered the book store. The final touches for the book launch were being held. He went to the washroom and stood in front of the mirror. After taking a deep breathe he texted Kritika, “Where are you?”
“Just come to the seminar hall at the 3th floor.” Came her reply.
Her reply left him confused.
“Why she is here this early? What is she doing in that hall? Is she in danger?”
To find the answers of all these questions, he moved towards the 3th floor. The corridors were completely silent.
He entered the hall. There was total darkness inside.
“Kritika…… Kritika…..?” He shouted in search of her.
Suddenly the lights turned ON. The big hall was fully decorated with balloons, flowers. The aura of the hall was captivating.
“Is he entered the wrong place? Is this someone’s birthday party or if Kritika is throwing a birthday party tonight?” All these questions were scratching his head when Kritika came smiling silently from a room at a corner.
As she walked towards him, the intensity of his heartbeats and the curve of his smile increased. For the first time, she was wearing the dress Arjun gifted him a few months back.
She was looking gorgeous. Those earrings, the eyelashes, that light lipstick shade only added to her charisma.
She was looking much more beautiful than all her filtered pictures on facebook which he used to stare all day.
“Kritika…” words were hardly coming out now.
She came to him, without saying even a single word she held her hand and took him to a chair nearby and made him sat there. He was numb, completely unaware about what was going on. He neither spoke nor reacted.
Kritika held a guitar and through her eyelashes stared him for a while. A chill ran down Arjun’s spin. He was perfectly perplexed. What was happening? What is it all about? Since he saw her today, the thought of book launch had left his brain. It’s her, only her.
Arjun was frozen, in immense surprise and shock both. This is not something he ever thought in his wildest dreams.
She started strumming synced with the lyrics of a hindi song.
Arjun knew kritika sings, but with such a soulful voice, he was shocked.
He loved music, and this is one of his favorite songs. Anyone can guess the level of his happiness by reading his face only.
This was the first time in his life when he was feeling special. A girl made him feel special for the first time.
“If this is a dream, just never wake me up god.” He whispered to himself.
He never expected that the girl he loved will sing his favorite song on a guitar only for him. His happiness was at the top of the world. But a big reason of happiness was yet to come.
Her voice has filled the hall with most romantic perfume, a melodious, heart blooming voice which Arjun was hypnotized by. She didn’t break that eye contact for a microsecond while singing. Her face had the most breathtaking smile like that cloudless dawn that had brightened up by the sunrise.


Kehte Hain Khuda Ne Iss Jahan Mein Sabhi Ke Liye
Kisi Na Kisi Ko Hai Banaya Har Kisi Ke Liye
Tera Milna Hai Uss Rab Ka Ishaara Maanu
Mujhko Banaya Tere Jaise Hi Kisi Ke Liye
Kehte Hain Khuda Ne Iss Jahan Mein Sabhi Ke Liye
Kisi Na Kisi Ko Hai Banaya Har Kisi Ke Liye
Tera Milna Hai Uss Rab Ka Ishaara Maanu
Mujhko Banaya Tere Jaise Hi Kisi Ke Liye
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
Kaise Hum Jaane Hume Kya Pata
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
Tu Humsafar Hai, Phir Kya Fikar Hai
Jeene Ki Wajah Hi Yahi Marna Issi Ke Liye
Kehte Hain Khuda Ne Iss Jahan Mein Sabhi Ke Liye
Kisi Na Kisi Ko Hai Banaya Har Kisi Ke Liye
Sa Ni Pa Di Na Sa...

He joined her with the lyrics. Their eyes were locked. That mutual love was reflecting in their eyes.

Meharbaani Jaate Jaate Mujh Pe Kar Gaya
Guzarta Sa Lamha Ek Daaman Bhar Gaya
Tere Nazara Mila, Roshan Sitaara Mila
Takdeer Ki Kashtiyon Ko, Kinara Mila
Sadiyon Se Tarse Hai Jaisi Zindagi Ke Liye
Teri Sauhbat Mein Duaayein Hain Ussi Ke Liye
Tere Milna Hai Uss Rab Ka Ishaara
Maanu Mujhko Banaya Tere Hi Jaise Kisi Ke Liye
Kehte Hain Khuda Ne Iss Jahan Mein Sabhi Ke Liye
Kisi Na Kisi Ko Hai Banaya Har Kisi Ke Liye
Tere Milna Hai Uss Rab Ka Ishaara
Maanu Mujhko Banaya Tere Hi Jaise Kisi Ke Liye
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
Kaise Hum Jaane Hume Kya Pata
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
Tu Humsafar Hai, Phir Kya Fikar Hai
Jeene Ki Wajah Hi Yahi Hai Marna Issi Ke Liye
Kehte Hain Khuda Ne Iss Jahan Mein Sabhi Ke Liye
Kisi Na Kisi Ko Hai Banaya Har Kisi Ke Liye

As the song ended, they both smiled staring each other.
Kritika put the guitar down and kneeled down in front of him.
“What happened?” He asked.
“I want to say something.”
“So you can say it normally na,”
“No idiot, this is special.” She smiled.
She took a deep breath while holding the eye contact with him and started,
“Arjun, this one year has been amazing with you by my side. Before you, I was just a sad soul, running towards my career. I left people, hardly talk to any. I forgot to laugh, to live. My previous experience of love or relationship used to haunt me every single night. I was broken. And then, you came into my life, almost by chance. You taught me how to love myself. You supported me, motivated me and directed a path to follow in life. Even your simple gud morning message makes my day. You are the reason I am this much confident today. I have faced so much negative people in my life. And here you are, with so much positivity. I just don’t wanna lose you ever. I wonder if we hadn’t met that night, what my life would have been today.
So, Mr. Arjun Thapar, I Kritika Mehta, think. Not only think but am sure that I am in love with you. And I just want to steal you from this world before it’s too late. So will you be my Mr. Right”
Arjun was statue, not only physically, but mentally too.
He was speechless. This simply made him blank.
“Is this really a dream? What he just heard was actually true or only his imagination.
In randomness, he uttered, “What the fuck.”
“What?” She shouted.
“No nothing.” He corrected.
“I heard you, you are such a bitch. A girl like me is proposing you on my knees, singing a song for you, and you are replying like this. Don’t you have any shame idiot?” She teased him.
“I am sorry. I didn’t mean that. This is all what………….” He stopped in the middle.
“What? Reply Now.” She was in complete anger.
“Yes I love you, since from the first day.” He finally confessed.
“So why didn’t you said this yet?”
“I don’t have that much confidence.”
“So now what?” He asked.
“You sure you are straight na?”
“What?”
“Now kiss me stupid.” She giggled.
Arjun came close to her. The closeness peaked their heartbeats. He held her waist and pulled her closer. She blushed.
When their lips met, she closed her eyes. All the events of this last year started flashing in front of Arjun’s eyes.
Their love intensified with every lip shuffle. Before it’s too late to resist the emotions, Kritika came back to her senses. Their lips separated. Arjun smiled while Kritika blushed. She hugged him tightly.
“Arjun…. Arjun…..” Himanshu entered the hall in search of him.
“Ohh sorry. I didn’t know……” He turned his smiling face in the other direction.
“Such a bad timing bro...” Kritika teased.
“I am sorry. Actually people are gathered at the store and they wanna meet you.”
“I am coming just 5 minutes.” Arjun replied.
Himanshu left.
“Let’s go then.” He said.
”I love you.” Kritika kissed him.
“Love you too.”
They started walking slowly through the corridors, Kritika holding his hand tightly.
“By the way, how did he know that we are here? And how you managed all this decors?” Arjun asked.
“Your two musketeers helped me with all this.” She replied.
“Seriously? They knew about all this.” Arjun said in surprise.
Kritika separated her hand when they reached the store.
People started clapping as he walked through them. He waited this day for years. He saw his mom, his friends standing there clapping for him. This was the 1st launch of his debut novel.
Everyone settled on their places. The book store manager introduced him to the audience. People started asking questions.
“So tell us, how it feels when your 1st novel is going to publish.” A young girl, of almost the same age asked him.
“Writing is something for which I skip my meals, resist studies and avoid outings. Like I am so much in love with this, I feel happy, satisfied, and emotional when I write. It’s a dream of every buddy writer that one day his novel get publish too. But only a few get this opportunity, I am short of words right now to express what I am feeling. It’s like If the destination is this beautiful. Then the journey was worth going through. You’ll come to know this when this happens with you.” Arjun replied with a big smile.
“Mr. Thapar, tell us about your novel. What it is based on? The Experiences you wanna share with us from this novel.” A magazine journalist asked with confidence.
“Actually, I was in search of a story. And this whole year had been a bit dramatic in my life. The story is about the incidents that all happened during this time.” Arjun Said. This attracted everyone’s attention towards him. Nobody knows what he is talking about. Neither Kritika nor his mom knows what has happened with him. No one had even a small idea about the story of his novel.
“So can you please read for us a small part of your novel?” The reporter asked again.
“Sure. “ The Shadows of Dark” ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… I was there alone checking my mobile notifications sitting on my bike. And I was about to leave when someone from behind hit me strongly with a bat. I lost my consciousness. I hardly remember what happened after that.
When I opened my eyes, I was some where I have never dreamed of to be there. I hardly believed my eyes. I was not feeling my legs. Who bought me here, and why? The headache was unbearable.”
